h2. Known Issues with Suhosin

Suhosin is a PHP extension that adds extra security measures to PHP. One of these, however, is a check to prevent access on a server if a GET variable is too long. This causes issues in the MODX manager in versions equal to or later than 2.2, as MODX uses [Google minify|http://code.google.com/p/minify] to minimize and compress the JavaScript in the manager.

This is remedied in setup/, as during MODX installation, MODX will attempt to find the value of suhosin.get.max_value_length, and if it&#39;s lower than 1024, turn off JS compression in the manager.

h3. Recommended Fix

If the user has suhosin on, and wants JS compression, it is recommended to set the offending param value to a higher limit, such as 4096 or greater. This can be done by editing the php.ini file and restarting the server:

{quote}suhosin.get.max_value_length = 4096{quote}
