Turns on friendly URLs, which generate SEO-friendly URL mappings for your Resources. The URL map is determined by the Resource&#39;s place in the site tree, and its &quot;alias&quot; field.

For example, a Resource with alias &#39;blog&#39; and a Content Type of &quot;HTML&quot; will be rendered as www.mysite.com/blog.html if it&#39;s not a container. If the blog Resource was under another Resource with an alias of &#39;test&#39;, then the blog Resource&#39;s URL would be:

{quote}www.mysite.com/test/blog.html{quote}

This allows for completely customizable and automatically built SEO-friendly URLs.

{note}To get this fully working, there are some extra steps involved. Please refer to [revolution20:Using Friendly URLs].

{zone-data:desc}If you are using friendly URLs, and the resource has an alias, the alias will always have precedence over the friendly URL. By setting this option to &#39;yes&#39;, the friendly URL prefix and suffix will also be applied to the alias. For example, if your resource with ID 1 has an alias of `introduction`, and you&#39;ve set a prefix of `` and a suffix of `.html`, setting this option to `yes` will generate `introduction.html`. If there&#39;s no alias, MODx will generate `1.html` as link.{zone-data}
