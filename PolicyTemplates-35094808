h2. What are Policy Templates?

Policy Templates are collections of Permissions. [Access Policies|Policies] use these to create lists of Permissions that Users can have. They are useful for making standard groups of policies for various access levels - such as, for example, an Administrator, a Moderator, or a Content Editor.

Although there is some overlap between the specific permissions defined in each policy template, each template contains mostly unique permissions.  Each template defines all the permissions that apply to the Access Control Lists (ACLs) they target; each is meant to be self-contained.

h3. MediaSourceTemplate
