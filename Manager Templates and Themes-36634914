The MODX manager uses a template much like regular MODX pages.  The manager&#39;s template files live inside of *manager/templates/default* directory.  You can update the system setting for the *manager_theme* to point to the new directory.

The way this is set up is just like extending a PHP class: you can override any single file by mimicking the directory structure and updating the *manager_theme* directory.

For example, to customize just the Manager Login template, you could copy the following file into a new directory:

*manager/templates/default/security/login.tpl*

Copy that file into a new directory, for example here:
