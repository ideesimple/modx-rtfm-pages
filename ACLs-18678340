h2. What is an ACL (Access Control List)?

An ACL, or Access Control List, is a set of [Permissions] attached to an object. More information on ACLs can be found [here in Wikipedia|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list].

h2. Usage

In MODx, ACLs can be applied to any modAccessibleObject. Primarily MODx Revolution 2.0 allows for ACLs on Resources and Contexts.

h3. Context ACL

A Context ACL is referenced of 4 parts:

* A [Context|Contexts]
* A [User Group|User Groups]
* A [Minimum Role|Roles]
* An [Access Policy|Policies]

This means that one can assign a ACL to a Context that will apply to:

* All the Users in a User Group
* ...with at least the Minimum Role specified
* ...that will give the Users all the Permissions in the Access Policy assigned.

h3. Resource ACL

Resource ACLs behave a bit differently, and basically allow you to restrict access to Resources (such as Documents, Weblinks, etc) by Resource Groups. They are comprised of 5 Parts:

* A [Resource Group|Resource Groups]
* A [User Group|User Groups]
* A [Minimum Role|Roles]
* An [Access Policy|Policies]
* A [Context|Contexts]

This means that an ACL applied to a Resource Group will:

* Effect all the Users in the specified User Group
* ... with at least the Minimum Role specified
* ... give the Resource Permissions (save, load, delete, etc) in the Policy specified
* ... to all the Resources in the Resource Group
