{warning}Automated upgrading from 0.9.6.\*/Evolution is not yet available in MODx Revolution 2.0.0. A migration tool will be provided sometime after the release of MODx Revolution 2.0.0.
{warning}
With that in mind, if you&#39;d \_still\_ like to upgrade, you&#39;re free to do so. However, we *strongly recommend backing up your data first*. Once you&#39;ve done so, simply run the upgrade mode in the setup/ program, and your database tables will be upgraded.

From there, a few things will happen. One, you&#39;ll probably notice most of your 3rd party scripts will be broken. You&#39;ll need to convert them to the Revolution core, as well as all of your tags to the new [Tag Syntax]. Component developers will hopefully already be converting their scripts by this point, so you may be able to find Revolution-compatible scripts via [Package Management], or on [modxcms.com|http://modxcms.com/extras.html] or in the [forums|http://www.modxcms.com/forums/].

Also, it&#39;s worth noting that there are no more &quot;web users&quot; or &quot;manager users&quot; - only Users. And the [new permissions scheme|Security] is vastly different than in 0.9.6/Evolution.

Again, we don&#39;t recommend this, but if you&#39;re a \*brave\* soul, feel free to backup and try it.
