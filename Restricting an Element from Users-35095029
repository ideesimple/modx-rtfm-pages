h2. Introduction

This tutorial teaches you how to restrict any Element (such as a Template, Snippet, etc) from view in the MODX manager. It uses Element Category ACLs to accomplish the task, which allow you to protect any Elements in Categories from view.

h3. Brief Summary

# Create a Category or use an existing one
# Place the Element you want to protect into your Category
# Create a User Group (Security \-&gt; Access Controls \-&gt; User Groups \-&gt; New User Group) or select a prior User Group
# Add the users you want to see the Element to the User Group with the role of Member.
# Add an Element Category ACL on the Element Category Access tab (context: mgr, minimum role: Member (9999), access policy: Element)
# Flush permissions (Security \-&gt; Flush Permissions) and reload

h2. Step-by-step Explanation

h3. 1. Create a Category

Click the Elements tab on the left-hand tree, and right-click &quot;Categories&quot; at the bottom, then click &quot;New Category&quot;. Create and save a new category. Alternatively, you can use an already-existing Category for this tutorial.

h3. 2. Place the Element into the Category

Simply drag/drop the Element you want to protect into the Category made in Step 1.

h3. 3. Create a User Group

Go to Security \-&gt; Access Controls in the top menu, and find the &quot;User Groups&quot; tab. Then either create a new User Group or select a prior one. From there, right-click on the User Group and select &quot;Update User Group&quot;.

h3. 4. Add the Users to the User Group

Find the Users tab, and then add any users you want to see the Element into this User Group. Make sure to give them a Role of *at least* Member.

h3. 5. Add the Element Category ACL

Find the &quot;Element Category Access&quot; tab on this screen. Click &quot;Add Category&quot; on the button above the grid. Select:

* Category: your Category you made/selected earlier
* Minimum Role: Member
* Access Policy: Element
* Context: mgr

Then save.

h3. 6. Flush Permissions

On the top menu, find &quot;Security \-&gt; Flush Permissions&quot; and click it. This will reload the page, and your Element Category will now be protected.

h2. Special Case for Templates

Lets say you restricted a Template with the method above. But you also want another User Group, which doesn&#39;t have access to the Template, the ability to edit (but not create!) Resources with that Template, and see the Template&#39;s TVs. Currently, the 2nd User Group (Let&#39;s call them Editors) would be able to see the Resource, and the ID of the Template will show in the Template combobox, but they wont be able to see the TVs. We need to add another ACL to the Editors User Group to get them to load the Template and its associated TVs.

* Go to the Editors User Group edit page (Security \-&gt; Access Controls \-&gt; User Groups \-&gt; right click on &quot;Editors&quot; and select Update User Group)
* Find the Element Category Access tab
* Add the following ACL:
** Category: your Category you made/selected earlier
** Minimum Role: Member
** Access Policy: Load Only
** Context: mgr
* Have the users in the Editors User Group logout and log back in, or alternatively click Security \-&gt; Flush Sessions in the top menu

Done! Your Editors will now be able to see and edit TVs for the Template in the protected Category.
