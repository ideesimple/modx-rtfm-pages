h2. What is a Rule?

Rules in MODx Revolution are simply generic rules that apply to any Action (manager page). They also can be tied to User Groups, wherein a Rule will only be applied if the User is part of that User Group.

h2. What are the Rules available?

The available Rules are:

{pagetree:root=Form Customization Rules}

h2. Creating a Rule

First off, go to the Form Customization page, under the Security main menu. From there, click &quot;Add&quot; in the grid&#39;s toolbar. You&#39;ll be presented with a window:

!fc-createRule.png!

Let&#39;s go into the fields.

||Field||Description||Optional||
|Action|This field lets you select any available [Action|Actions and Menus]. The rule will only apply to that Action, and no other.|{color:red}No{color}|
|User Group|Here you can optionally choose a [User Group|User Groups] to tie this Rule to. If a User Group is chosen, the Rule will only apply to [Users] of that User Group.|{color:green}Yes{color}|
|Description|An optional, for you, description of the Rule.|{color:green}Yes{color}|
|Field|The name of the field or tab to apply the Rule to.|{color:red}No{color}|
|Containing Panel|The name of the containing panel that the Field or Tab exists in. Most all Rules will need this value.|{color:red}No{color}|
|Value|The value you&#39;d like to set the Rule to. The type of value can vary depending on the Rule.|{color:red}No{color}|
|Constraint Class|If set, will restrict the Rule to a field value (via Constraint Field and Constraint) on this class. Example: modResource for the Resource Update screen.|{color:green}Yes{color}|
|Constraint Field|If set, will restrict the Rule to the field specified, with the value of Constraint|{color:green}Yes{color}|
|Constraint|If set, will restrict the Rule to the value of the field in the object specified in the constraint options.|{color:green}Yes{color}|

h2. Constraints

Rule Constraints are special abilities that let you restrict the Rule to a certain value on an object&#39;s field. Let&#39;s say you want to restrict a Rule for resource/update to only occur on Resource&#39;s with a Template ID of 4. You&#39;d simply set the Constraints like so:

* *Constraint Class*: modResource
* *Constraint Field*: template
* *Constraint*: 4

Or, further, if you wanted to restrict the Rule to Resources with a menutitle of &quot;boo&quot;:

* *Constraint Class*: modResource
* *Constraint Field*: menutitle
* *Constraint*: boo

Constraints allow a superior level of flexibity to [Form Customization Rules].
