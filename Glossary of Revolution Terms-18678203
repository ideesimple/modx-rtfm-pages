----
h3. Component

Also called &quot;Third-party Component&quot;, or 3PC, a Component usually provides extra functionality to MODx, usually in the form of an Add-on, Core Extension, or Template.

----
h3. Content Type

h3. Core Workspace

Each unique MODx Core is represented by a named Workspace. When you install Revolution initially, the MODx Core used by the setup application is recorded into the MODx database as the Default MODx Workspace. In future MODx Revolution releases, there will be an ability to manage multiple Workspaces from a single database, directly from the manager application. This will make it easy to isolate upgrades to the MODx Core; by quickly adding a new Core Workspace and selecting a menu option, you&#39;ll be able to apply an entire new MODx Core installation to production sites after testing on a staging site, or quickly revert to a previous Core Workspace you know works. This will be especially important for multi-site configurations running on shared MODx Core installations.

A type of Resource that references a specific URL or MODx Resource, redirecting the visitor to that URL or Resource.

----
h3. Validator (for xPDOVehicles)

Pre-processor: a script or predefined action that executes prior to the vehicle being installed or uninstalled. If the validator returns true, the install/uninstall action will proceed as normal. If the validator returns false, MODx will not uninstall or install the package.

A Validator could be used to determine if a directory exists and is writable, to see if other modx elements are already installed, or to determine if a certain version of MySQL and PHP are used on a server.

h3. Resolver (for xPDOVehicles)

Post-processor: a script or predefined action that is evaluated after a Vehicle is installed or uninstalled. Resolvers always occur after the vehicle&#39;s object is save()&#39;d, and can then perform actions on MODx before anything else happens in the install/uninstall process.

An example of a PHP Resolver is one that attaches Plugin Events to a newly-installed Plugin.

An example of a file Resolver is one that copies the assets/ditto directory in the xPDOVehicle path to /modx/assets/ditto.

A type of Resource that references a specific URL or MODx Resource, redirecting the visitor to that URL or Resource.

h3. Validator (for xPDOVehicles)

Pre-processor: a script or predefined action that executes prior to the vehicle being installed or uninstalled. If the validator returns true, the install/uninstall action will proceed as normal. If the validator returns false, MODx will not uninstall or install the package.

A Validator could be used to determine if a directory exists and is writable, to see if other modx elements are already installed, or to determine if a certain version of MySQL and PHP are used on a server.

----
h3. xPDOVehicle

The base Transport Vehicle class, xPDOVehicle, stores xPDOObject instances (which represent a row of data in a table) in it&#39;s payload, along with various attributes that control how the object is installed/uninstalled in a Core Workspace (see xPDOVehicle Validators and xPDOVehicle Resolvers).
