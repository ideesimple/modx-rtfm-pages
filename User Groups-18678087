h2. What is a User Group?

A User Group is simply a collection of Users.

h2. Usage

Go to Security \-&gt; Access Controls. From there you will see a tree of User Groups and their respective Users. You can assign a User to a User Group by right-clicking on the User Group and either:

* Adding the User via the context menu item
* Editing the User Group and adding a User on the grid there

h3. Assigning Policies

A quick clarification on which policies to use:

* Policies assigned on the Context Access tab should be based on the standard Administrator policy.
* Policies assigned on the Resource Group Access tab should be based on the standard Resource policy.
* Policies assigned on the Element Category Access tab should be based on the standard Element policy.

h2. Roles in User Groups

Users can have specific Roles within a User Group, should you choose. They can also exist in the User Group without a Role. Roles allow you to fine-tune your permissions more than in previous MODx versions.

Say you want to only allow Supervisors in the &quot;HR Department&quot; User Group access to some Resources; no problem. Just create a Role called &quot;Supervisor&quot;, set its authority to some number below 9999 (let&#39;s say 3), and then add in the Users to the User Group &quot;HR Department&quot; (via the User Group editing screen), setting any would-be supervisors to the Supervisor Role.

Then, you&#39;ll just add a Resource Policy (the packaged-in-with-modx one will do fine) to the Resource Group you want to restrict access to. It will look something like this:

!ug-rg-grid1.png!

And you&#39;ve got a role-based access permission\! This specific ACL will limit all Resources (aka Documents) in the web context and in the resource group &quot;TestResourceGroup4&quot; to only Users in the &quot;HR Department&quot; User Group with at least a Role of Supervisor. Roles with lower authority numbers would also inherit access - say you had a Coordinator Role with an authority of 2; Users in this User Group would have access to this ACL as well.
