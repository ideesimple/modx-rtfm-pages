h2. The Problem

You want a User to have manager editing access, but not have all the [Permissions] of an Administrator user. This tutorial, partially written by BobRay, will help you through that.

h2. The Solution

First off, create your user. Then:

# Create a new role (say, Editor) with an authority of say, 10.
# Add the User to the &quot;Administrator&quot; group with a role of &quot;Editor&quot;
# In Access Controls | Policies, duplicate the administrator policy and rename it to whatever you want, say &quot;Editor&quot;.
# Edit the AdminLite Policy to use whatever [Permissions] you want the User to have.
# In Access Controls | User Groups, right click on the &quot;Administrator&quot; group and select &quot;Update Group.&quot;
# On the Context Access tab, add two new entries to the grid:
## Context: &#39;mgr&#39;  Minimum Role: &#39;Editor&#39;, Access Policy &#39;AdminLite&#39;
## Context: &#39;web&#39;  Minimum Role: &#39;Editor&#39;, Access Policy &#39;Load, List and View&#39;
# Click on Security -&gt; Flush Sessions and re-login.
