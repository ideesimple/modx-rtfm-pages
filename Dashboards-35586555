h2. What are Dashboards?

A Dashboard in MODX is the page that shows on initial loading of the MODX manager, or when clicking the &quot;Dashboard&quot; link in the top-left of the screen. Dashboards can contain an unlimited number of &quot;widgets&quot;, which are boxes that show various content on the Dashboard. Widgets can be arranged in any order, and can be either a file, a MODX Snippet, or straight HTML.

Each User Group in MODX is assigned a Dashboard by default. This means that you can give different Users different Dashboards via the User Group they belong to. 

{info}If a User is part of two different groups, it will use the Dashboard of its Primary Group, which can be set in the User editing screen.{info}
