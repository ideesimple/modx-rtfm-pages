h2. What is xPDO?

*OpenExpedio* is the name for _open eXtensions to_ PDO. It&#39;s a light-weight ORB (object-relational bridge) (also see [ORM|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping]). It implements the very simple, but effective, Active Record pattern for data access. The library works on PHP 4 (xPDO 1.0 only) and 5, and takes advantage of the newly adopted standard for database persistence in PHP 5.1+.
