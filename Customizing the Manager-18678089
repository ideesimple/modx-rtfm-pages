h2. What is Form Customization?

Form Customization is a new feature that allows users to create Rules, which govern how manager pages render their forms in the MODX Revolution Manager. It is similar to ManagerManager in MODX Evolution.

{widget:url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJB_IXg7NNc|width=500|height=350}


h2. How Does it Work?

Currently, Form Customization has 3 layers:

{quote}Profile -&gt; Sets -&gt; Rules{quote}

A Profile is a collection of Sets, and Sets are collections of Rules. Profiles can be restricted to specific User Groups.

A Set is a collection of Rules, and is tied to a certain view. Normally, you would have a Set for the Resource/Create page, and a Set for the Resource/Update page. Sets can also be tied to specific [Templates] (meaning they load only when the Resource is using that Template). They can also have a &#39;Constraint&#39; set, which limits the Set&#39;s execution to the restriction made in the Constraint.

A Rule is all the variations applied in a Set. Rules are hidden from view in MODX Revolution, but are instead shown as fields on the Set Editing page.

More information about each of the parts of Form Customization can be found in each part&#39;s respective page:

h2. What is Form Customization?

Form Customization is a new feature that allows users to create Rules, which govern how manager pages render their forms in the MODx Revolution Manager. It is similar to ManagerManager in MODx Evolution.

h2. What are [Rules|Form Customization Rules]?

[Rules|Form Customization Rules] in MODx Revolution are simply generic rules that apply to any [Action|Actions and Menus] (manager page). They also can be tied to User Groups, wherein a Rule will only be applied if the User is part of that User Group.

A rule can be one of the following:

{pagetree:root=Form Customization Rules|startDepth=1}

h2. What Forms can I Customize?

Technically any manager page can be customized. Form Customization bases its methods off of [Actions|Actions and Menus], which are database representations of any MODx Revolution Manager page. This also means that [Custom Manager Pages] can also have Rules applied to them, should the CMPs be using [MODExt].

A full list of documented customizable forms, along with their fields and other info, can be found here:

{pagetree:root=Form Customization Pages|startDepth=1}

h2. Examples

An example set of Rules:
!rc-grid.png|thumbnail!

will make the Resource Update page look like so:
!rc-ex1.png|thumbnail!

and TV part look like:

!rc-ex1tv.png|thumbnail!
