Adding translations is fairly simple in MODX.

h2. The Core Manager Lexicon

If your language is not in the provided translations, you can fairly simply add a translation of the manager interface by copying the following directory, and renaming to your IANA code for your language (example: &quot;de&quot; for German, &quot;it&quot; for Italian):

{quote}core/lexicon/en/ -\&gt; core/lexicon/\[mylanguage\]/{quote}

So, for example, if we wanted to create a Haitian translation (&quot;ht&quot;), we would just copy core/lexicon/en/ to core/lexicon/ht/. Then we would edit the .inc.php files in the core/lexicon/ht/ directory, translating the string values there into Haitian.

h2. The Setup Lexicon

A similar process can be done for the installer, if you so choose. Just copy the following directory and rename - similarly to how you do the core manager lexicon:

{quote}setup/lang/en/ -\&gt; setup/lang/\[mylanguage\]/ {quote}

h2. Extras Lexicons

Often, Extras lexicons can be found in their respective directories in the core/components/ directory. For example, [Quip&#39;s|ADDON:Quip] is found here:

{quote}core/components/quip/lexicon/en/{quote}

You can copy the &quot;en&quot; directory and repeat the normal process to translate it as well.

h2. Contributing Translations

Consider contributing your core translations to the MODX core by submitting a Pull Request on [GitHub|https://github.com/modxcms/revolution]. Contributions require a [CLA signature|http://modx.com/cla/].
