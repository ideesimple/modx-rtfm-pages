h2. What are System Events?

System Events are the events in MODx that [Plugins] are registered to. They are &#39;fired&#39; throughout the MODx code, allowing Plugins to interact with MODx code and add custom functionality without hacking core code.

h2. The Model of a System Event

The system events table is found under \{table_prefix\}_system_eventnames, and has the following fields:

* *id* - The unique ID of the event.
* *name* - The name of the event. This is how they are referenced in code, via the [modX.invokeEvent] method.
* *service* - What type of system event this event is.
* *groupname* - Used for user interfaces, primarily for filtering, grouping and sorting of events. Not used explicitly in the modx model.

h3. Service Types

The &#39;service&#39; field in the System event is a number; the numbers reference different types of System Events. They are:

* 1 - Parser Service Events
* 2 - Manager Access Events
* 3 - Web Access Service Events
* 4 - Cache Service Events
* 5 - Template Service Events
* 6 - User Defined Events

3 is not fired in the &#39;mgr&#39; context; 2 is not fired in any context but &#39;mgr&#39;.

h2. Available Events

{note}This is not an exhaustive list as events are still being documented. Thank you for your patience. The TV, Template and Snippet events are still to be documented. For a complete list, please either view a Plugin in the manager and see the System Events tab, or view [here|https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/blob/develop/_build/data/transport.core.events.php]. Note also that all WUsr (web-user) events have been removed.{note}
