h2. Output Types for TVs

Output Types (also called Renders) on [Template Variables] allow you to format the value of a TV to any different kind of output - such as a URL, image, date, or anything else you can think of.

For example, say you have a TV that uses a Textbox as its Input Type. The user would then choose an Image through the TV input on their Resource. That&#39;s great - except your TV only outputs the URL of the image! You want it to output the image itself. So you&#39;d then choose the Output Render of the TV to be an Image, and boom! Your image TV now outputs the image directly! Sweet, huh?

MODx Revolution comes packaged with a few default Output Types. You can also [create your own|Adding a Custom TV Output Type], if you know a little PHP. The list of pre-packaged ones are:
