This article describes how to add a [Media Source|Media Sources] to your MODX installation.

h2. Creating the Media Source

First find your way to the Media Sources page, often located under &quot;Tools&quot;. From here, you will see a grid of your currently available media sources:

!20110907-8gp9xhgh2dphmhbnwsihtxaeya.jpeg!

Before we proceed, it is important to note the difference between a &quot;Media Source&quot; and a &quot;Media Source Type&quot; - a source type is a classification of a Source, such as a S3 Source Type, or a Filesystem Source Type. These types point the Source to different media storage systems.

For now, go ahead and create a Media Source by clicking on the &quot;Create New Media Source&quot; button above the grid. This should pop up a window with a basic form for the source:

Go ahead and choose the Filesystem source type for now, and give it a nice name. For information on creating an S3 Media Source, [click here|Media Source Type - S3]. Once that&#39;s done, you&#39;ll see your Media Source in the grid. Right-click on it, and click &quot;Update Media Source&quot;.

h2. Editing your new Media Source

This screen will show your new media source&#39;s basic information, a grid with type-specific properties for the source that you can change, and an &quot;Access Permissions&quot; tab that will let you restrict access to the source.

For now, go ahead and set the &#39;basePath&#39; property to &quot;assets/&quot;, and then the &#39;baseUrl&#39; property to &quot;assets/&quot; as well. Save the source.

{note:title=Right-Click Only}
All properties are available only after you have created the Media Source and then right-click it to edit it.
{note}

The other available properties include the following:

* basePath
* basePathRelative (yes|no)
* baseUrl
* baseUrlRelative (yes|no)
* allowedFileTypes
* imageExtensions
* thumbnailType
* thumbnailQuality
* skipFiles


h2. Using Your Source

After you&#39;ve created it, you should be able to see the source in the dropdown in the left-hand tree under the Files tab. If you select that source, you should now only be able to see the contents of the &#39;assets/&#39; directory in your MODX installation! (If you have not yet created an assets/ directory in your install, do so now.)

Furthermore, you can attach this Source to a TV. Read the [Assigning Media Sources to TVs] article to learn how.";s:8:"versions";a:2:{i:0;a:3:{s:2:"id";s:8:"35586535";s:3:"ver";s:1:"2";s:4:"code";s:2444:"{toc}
