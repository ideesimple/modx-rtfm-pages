Extras are most commonly stored in 2 directories when they are installed:

* *core/components/* - This is the location for all the PHP and non-web-accessible files for the Extra.
* *assets/components/* - This is the location for the web-accessible files for the Extra, such as CSS, JS and images.

Why the separation? Well, since MODx users can move the core outside the webroot, separating out the non-accessible files into core/components allows MODx developers to add an extra level of security to their Extras.
