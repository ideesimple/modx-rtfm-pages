h2. What is the @DIRECTORY Binding?

The DIRECTORY binding reads the contents of a directory.  This can really useful when you tie it into a List control widget, e.g. if you want to do something like give the user a list of logo images to choose for a page, or choose which mp3 file plays on a particular page.  REMEMBER: it returns *ALL* contents of a directory, including all files and all directories - with the sole exception of directories prefixed with a period.

h2. Usage

When you create a Template Variable, place the following text into the&amp;nbsp;*Input Option Values* box:


{code}@DIRECTORY /path/to/some_directory{code}

Frequently, this is coupled with an Input Type of &quot;DropDown List Menu&quot; to allow the user to select a file from the list.
{note}In MODx Revolution, the path used for the @DIRECTORY binding is relative to the site&#39;s root.  It is *not* an absolute file path. If you want to list files above your site&#39;s root, you must use the &quot;..&quot; syntax, e.g. *@DIRECTORY /../dir_above_root* &amp;nbsp;This binding will work with or without a trailing slash in the directory name.{note}
If you are using the @DIRECTORY binding for your template variable \[\[*myTV\]\], you can easily imagine that your template code could have some stuff in it like:

{code}&lt;img src=&quot;[[*myTV]]&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;{code}

h2. Additional Info

Can you filter which files are selected?  E.g. using \*.jpg?  The following DOES NOT WORK:

{code}@DIRECTORY /list/*.jpg  # doesn&#39;t work!{code}

There are PHP code snippets out there that emulate this functionality.  See the following forum thread: [http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3124.0.html]

h2. Security

Depending on how the file is used on the page, it may pose a security risk.  Be careful if you were using this binding to select JavaScript files to be executed.  What if a user had the ability to upload (and thus execute) a JavaScript file? Also, always be wary of letting users see your directory structure.
