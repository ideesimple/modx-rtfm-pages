This article describes how to assign a Media Source to a TV. It is recommended to read the [Adding a Media Source] article before reading this one.

{info}Only &quot;image&quot; and &quot;file&quot; type TVs use Sources at this time.{info}

h2. Creating the TV

First we will start by creating a TV that we will attach a media source to. Go ahead and create a TV called &quot;TestSourceTV&quot;, and save it. Notice then you&#39;ll see a new tab on your TV, a &quot;Media Sources&quot; tab. This will have a grid of [Contexts] that are available, and the Sources that are associated with those Contexts.

This means that TVs can use different Sources per Context. This will take effect when editing a TV in a Resource from that Context, as well as when that TV is rendered in that Context.

For now, go ahead and assign all contexts to the Source &quot;My New Source&quot;, which we created in the [Adding a Media Source] article. Set your TV&#39;s input type, under the &quot;Input Options&quot; tab, to &quot;image&quot;. Assign it to a Template. Save your TV.

h2. Limiting the Source to Specific Folders

Often, you&#39;ll want users to select files from a specific folder when selecting a value for a TV.  You can set up this restriction when you define your Media Source.  

1. First, create your Media Source under *Tools \-&gt; Media Sources*
2. After you&#39;ve created the Media Source, right-click it and select &quot;Update Media Source&quot;
3. Scroll down and edit the following properties:

* *basePath* - set to something like &quot;assets/images/&quot;  
* *baseUrl* - set to something like &quot;assets/images/&quot;  

Leave *basePathRelative* and *baseUrlRelative* set to &quot;Yes&quot;.  That&#39;s the most common way to set this up.

{note}*basePath* and *baseUrl* should start _without_ a slash, but they should end with a trailing slash.{note}

h2. Editing the TV

Now, when you edit that TV in a Resource, you&#39;ll notice that it uses the Source we created earlier:

!20110907-pd72jtn9bhdbn5q5qb7wadku5a.jpeg!

Clicking the dropdown will load the MODx.Browser window using the Source that we specified - note that our source here only loads the contents of the assets/ directory.

Now we&#39;ll probably want to consider restricting access to this Source, so that our Content Editors can&#39;t accidentally edit it and mess it up. Read the [next article|Securing a Media Source] to find out how.
