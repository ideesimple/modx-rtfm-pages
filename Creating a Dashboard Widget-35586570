This article describes how to create a custom Dashboard Widget, including a short description of the different Dashboard Widget types and how they work.

h2. Creating a Basic Widget

Go to the Dashboards page (Dashboard -&gt; Dashboards in the top menu), and click on the &quot;Widgets&quot; tab. Then, click on &quot;Create New Widget&quot;, and this will load the Widget creation screen. You&#39;ll see a few new fields:

* *Name* - The name of your new widget. Let&#39;s call ours &quot;Hello World&quot;.
* *Description* - A short description of your widget, used internally.
* *Widget Type* - The type of Widget. We&#39;ll get into this more later, but for now, just select &quot;HTML&quot;.
* *Size* - Widgets come in 3 sizes - half, full, and double. A half-sized widget takes up half of one row. A full takes up one whole row. A double takes up 2 rows.
* *Namespace* - The Namespace to associate the widget with. Useful for Extras developers; but for us, let&#39;s keep it at &quot;core&quot;.
* *Lexicon* - Adds an ability to load a lexicon with this widget. Let&#39;s go ahead and leave ours at &quot;core:dashboards&quot;, the default setting.

You&#39;ll note that as you type the name of the widget, text appears below it following what you type. This is the automatic translation tool for Widget names; if you were to type a Lexicon Entry key, it would translate it (try typing &quot;widget_create&quot; for kicks to see what it does).

Now, in your dashboard widget content, go ahead and put this:

{code}&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;{code}

Our widget should look like this:

!dashboard-create1.png!

Go ahead and save the Widget.

h3. Assigning the Widget to the Default Dashboard

Now that we&#39;ve got our widget, let&#39;s assign it to the Default Dashboard, by going back to the main Dashboards page, clicking on the &quot;Dashboards&quot; tab, and finding the default Dashboard. Right-click on it, and click &quot;Update Dashboard&quot;. This will load the Default Dashboard editing page.

From here, click the &quot;Place Widget&quot; button above the Widgets grid on this page. Select our &quot;Hello World&quot; widget from the dropdown, and click save. Now our Widget is on the Dashboard! Let&#39;s go ahead and place it in position #2 by dragging it between the &quot;Configuration Check&quot; widget and the &quot;MODX News Feed&quot; widget:

!dashboard-create2.png!

Save your Dashboard.

h3. Viewing the Widget

Now, if you click the &quot;Dashboard&quot; top menu item on the page, you can see your new dashboard widget in place!
