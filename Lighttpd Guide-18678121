h2. Lighttpd Guide for Setup and Friendly URLs.
{note} 
* This is still a work in progress, and currently only covers the URL rewriting aspect. 
* This guide assumes you already have a working lighttpd, mysql, and PHP installation.
* This guide only covers proper settings and the use of friendly URL Rewriting. {note}

h3. Friendly URL Setup
{note} lighttpd does not use the same system, or even same idea as Apache does for URL rewriting. All URL rewriting is done in the lighttpd.conf file{note}

* First we need to make sure that the URL rewriting module is enabled. 
** So open your lighttpd.conf config file (In Linux it is usually located in /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf)
** Look for the directive server.modules. 
** Under this directive, look for an entry named &quot;mod_rewrite&quot;,. 
** By default it has a # in front of it. This is a comment symbol. Please remove the # from the line and save the file.

* Next we need to find the location in which to put the friendly URL code.
** So lets search for something that looks like this: 
   {code}
   $SERVER[&quot;socket&quot;] == &quot;:80&quot; {
  $HTTP[&quot;host&quot;] =~ &quot;yourdomainname.com&quot; {
    server.document-root = &quot;/path/to/your/doc/root&quot;
    server.name = &quot;yourservername&quot;
    {code}
** Directly under this you should add the following code.
{code}url.rewrite-once = ( &quot;^/(assets|manager|core|connectors)(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/$1/$2&quot;,
                         &quot;^/(?!index(?:-ajax)?\.php)(.*)\?(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/index.php?q=$1&amp;$2&quot;,
                         &quot;^/(?!index(?:-ajax)?\.php)(.*)$&quot; =&gt; &quot;/index.php?q=$1&quot;
                   ){code}

{note} This does not mean you are done! Lighttpd handles url-rewrites a bit differently. You HAVE to exclude any files or folders you do not want rewritten in the config file. Excluded dirs/files in the example above are (assets|manager|core|connectors). If you wish to add more to these, simple add another | followed by the folder or filename you wish to omit from url rewriting. {note}
{tip} After this is done, you will have working friendly URLs again in lighttpd. {tip}
